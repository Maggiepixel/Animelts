<h2> Who are we</h2>

<p> We are Animelts by Maggie! Animelts is mix of the words animation/anime and melting. I love to make cartoon characters out of Perler Beads. 
This craft uses small beads that create pixelated art. The beads fuse together by melting them with an iron.  The name is a great combination of 
art and function.

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
Hello, my name is Maggie and I am the founder of Animelts by Maggie. I created Animelts to make an outlet for my art and a way to help my community. I loved 
Perler Beads and wanted to share my art with others that liked the nerdy thing as me.  I am a active member of 4-H.
