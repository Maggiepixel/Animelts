    <h2> Our Story </h2>
   <p> Animelts is a company that I created to sell my perler bead creations. It was created in February 2020. To date I have sold around 15 projects
   and have donated over 200 face mask holders to healthcare providers in our area. The dream of Animelts is to make products that make people 
   happy and to give back most of the profit back into my community. </p>


    <h2>Sample Perler Bead</h2>

    <p> This is a 12 inches by 7.5 inches perler bead  of the chacter Goku. It is made up of about 1,000 beads that were hand placed. </p>
    <!-- For this I will write Goku but on the real page I will not because of copyright-->
